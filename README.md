# Python-Project
Examination Failure Analysis Project
# Task #1: Dataset Creation
## Create Dataset:

Constructed a dataset with 5 attributes: test_score, writing_skill, reading_skill, study_hours, and attendance.
Used pandas DataFrame to organize data with 10 records.
## Alternative DataFrame Creation:

Generated a dataset using NumPy for synthetic data and created a DataFrame with similar attributes.
# Task #2: Code Organization and Analysis
## Library Imports:

Created a section for importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
## Data Preprocessing:

Imported the dataset from GitHub and checked its structure, including the number of columns and rows.
Explored the dataset by examining unique categories, sample records, and dataset dimensions.
## Data Analysis:

Analyzed the dataset by identifying unique categories in the target variable.
Extracted specific samples and performed statistical analysis including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
## Additional Analysis:

Conducted statistical analysis on subsets of data.
Performed graphical visualizations to assess distributions, correlations, and outliers.
# Task #3: Graphical Visualization
Visualization:
Created visualizations to display correlations, distributions, and outliers in the dataset.
